Explain how you can still find an element in log time when the array is rotated: 

1. Find the pivot point and divide the array in two sub-arrays 
2. call binary search for one of the two sub-arrays 
(a) if element is greater than 0th element, search in left array 
(b) else search in right array 
3. if element is found in selected sub-array then return index. Else return -1. 

What is promise chaining?
